# Retail Analytics Demo  
### This project demonstrates a foundational approach to analyzing retail transaction data using Python. It highlights several key techniques for extracting actionable insights from raw sales, customer, and product data.  

## Project Overview
The analysis includes:  
Sales Performance  
Monthly sales trend visualization  
Store-level revenue and discount behavior  
Product Insights  
Total sales by product category  
Discounting trends by category  
Units sold and average sales per transaction  
Customer Segmentation  
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling  
KMeans clustering to define customer behavior groups  
Visual segmentation by recency and monetary value  

## Data Description  
The dataset used is a CSV file containing simulated retail transactions with the following fields:
CustomerID  
ProductID  
ProductCategory  
TransactionDate  
Quantity  
Price  
DiscountApplied(%)  
TotalAmount  
StoreLocation  
PaymentMethod  

Note: This is sample/demo data intended for analytical demonstration, not production use and downloaded from Kaggle.  

## Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x  
Pandas – data manipulation  
Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization  
Scikit-learn – machine learning for clustering  
Jupyter Notebook – interactive development  

## Future Improvements  
Add profitability analysis using estimated cost/margin data  
Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Power BI)  
Forecast future sales using time series models  
Expand customer segmentation with behavioral/demographic features  

## Purpose  
This project is meant to demonstrate exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic modeling techniques that can help organizations:  
Understand retail performance  
Tailor promotions and discounts  
Identify valuable customer segments  
Support more informed operational decisions
